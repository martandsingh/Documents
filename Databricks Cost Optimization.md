# Unlock Massive Savings: Top Strategies to Slash Your Databricks Monthly Costs!

Saving on Databricks costs is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Budget Efficiency**: Databricks, as a powerful data platform, can become quite expensive, especially for large-scale operations. Reducing costs helps companies manage their budgets more effectively and allocate resources to other critical areas.
2. **Competitive Advantage**: Lower operational costs can enhance a company's competitive edge by allowing them to invest more in innovation, marketing, and customer service, rather than spending on infrastructure.
3. **Scalability**: Effective cost management ensures that as data needs grow, companies can scale their operations without encountering prohibitive costs. This scalability is essential for businesses that anticipate expansion.
4. **Profit Margins**: For businesses with tight profit margins, every dollar saved on operational expenses directly impacts the bottom line. Cost savings from Databricks can significantly improve overall profitability.
5. **Resource Allocation**: Reducing expenses frees up budget for other strategic initiatives, such as research and development, talent acquisition, or new technology investments.
6. **Predictable Spending**: By optimizing costs, companies can achieve more predictable and manageable monthly expenses, making financial planning and forecasting more accurate.
7. **Value Maximization**: Effective cost management ensures that the investment in Databricks is delivering maximum value. It allows businesses to leverage the platform's capabilities without overspending.

Overall, cost savings in Databricks is about achieving a balance between harnessing the platform’s full potential and maintaining financial prudence.


#Using the wrong resources in Databricks can lead to high billing in several ways:

1. **Over-Provisioned Clusters**: Selecting larger or more powerful clusters than necessary for a given task can result in paying for unused or underutilized compute capacity. For example, using high-memory or high-CPU instances for simple, less demanding jobs leads to higher costs without additional benefits.
2. **Under-Provisioned Clusters**: Conversely, using clusters that are too small or underpowered for the workload can lead to inefficiencies and slower processing times. This can cause jobs to take longer to complete, potentially leading to higher costs due to extended resource usage.
3. **Improper Cluster Sizing**: Choosing instances with more resources than required for specific tasks can cause unnecessary expenses. For instance, running a data analysis job that only needs basic compute power on a high-performance instance results in paying for excess capacity.
4. **Non-Optimized Data Storage**: Using inefficient storage solutions or not managing data lifecycle properly can lead to higher storage costs. Storing data in premium tiers or not using features like data compression and optimization can add to expenses.
5. **Inappropriate Instance Types**: Different types of compute instances have varying costs. Using specialized or high-performance instance types for tasks that don’t require them can be more expensive. For example, using GPU-optimized instances for non-GPU tasks unnecessarily increases costs.
6. **Inefficient Query Design**: Running poorly optimized or inefficient queries can consume more compute resources and time, leading to higher costs. Queries that are not well-structured or involve scanning large amounts of data can significantly impact the billing.
7. **Persistent Clusters**: Keeping clusters running continuously when they’re not needed can lead to high costs. For example, running a cluster 24/7 when it’s only needed for specific time windows wastes resources and drives up the bill.
8. **High-Availability Features**: Implementing high-availability and redundancy features, such as having multiple clusters for failover or using multiple availability zones, can increase costs. If these features are not necessary for the workload, they can lead to additional expenses.
9. **Improper Scaling**: Not setting up auto-scaling correctly can lead to either over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources. Over-provisioning results in paying for more compute power than needed, while under-provisioning can cause delays and extended job runtimes.
10. **Unmanaged Data Transfers**: If data is frequently transferred in and out of the Databricks environment or between different cloud regions, it can incur additional data egress and transfer charges.

To avoid high billing, it’s crucial to carefully assess and select appropriate resources based on the specific needs of your workloads. Regularly monitoring usage, optimizing queries, and adjusting resource configurations can help manage costs effectively.

```This document is related to understand mainly on how choosing a wrong cluster configuration or type can lead a very high OPEX cost. Here we will discuss how can you manage your jobs, compute and multiple environment.```

```Before going further, we must understand that the whole article is based on a few assmptions:```
1. We are following lakehouse architecture, though these practices are common and will be helpful for all the usecases.
2. The organization has different databricks workspaces for dev, staging and production.
3. The organization is using SQL warehouse cluster.

```So one day you wakeup and have your coffee as always. It is just a wonderful day as always until you see a budget exceeding alert for you data platform. Believe me!! that will wake you up faster than your freshly brewed coffee. Somehow you gather the courage to open the email and find out your monthly budget exceeded by more than 60%. What will you do?```

```Before going to the databricks clusters and reduce the cluster capacity, we should understand first what is wrong with the whole incidence?```

# How to monitor databricks usage?
Databricks provides you demo dashboards which are quite helpful when it comes to monitor your workspace usage. You may not see those dashboard by default in your "dashboard" tab. To enable that you must run below commands:
#### import dbdemos
#### dbdemos.install('uc-04-system-tables', catalog='main', schema='billing_forecast')
Above command will enable demo dashboard. It will create a sql warehouse cluster, if you already have one you can delete that later and use the existing one.

# Where to find these dashboards?
You can go to the dashboard tab in databricks as shown below:

You will see a list of dashboard with [dbdemos] prefix.
